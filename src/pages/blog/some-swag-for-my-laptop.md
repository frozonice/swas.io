![Laptop Swags](../../images/mac-stickers.jpg)

Just got some stickers from [JustStickers](https://juststickers.in/) today. The
only site which sells some swags for developers like us.

Just sharing my wishlist incase someone would like to make some and let me know ðŸ˜‰.

-   The react sticker could have been more **rounder**, cut along the spirals.
-   Wish I had [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) stickers.
-   The stickers could've been a little more glossy.

Pretty Awesome ðŸ’¥ðŸŽ‰.
