So I have been thinking to shift by personal blog to a better system for a long time. After I started my adventure with React, it was clear to me that Gatsby is indeed the choice.

So for past three days, I researched on many things and finally set up my blog under this brand new domain.

This post is just to try out some things.

Here is a demo: <a href="https://t.co/o5TtYX94c3">https://t.co/o5TtYX94c3</a></p>&mdash; Dan Abramov (@dan_abramov) <a href="https://twitter.com/dan_abramov/status/1001399109444620288?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 29, 2018</a></blockquote>

And that's all. Hope these things work.
