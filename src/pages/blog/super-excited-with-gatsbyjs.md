So my optimization is nearly complete and I am amazed to see the power and
potential of [gatsbyjs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/). I have just started learning
[GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) and it is amazing 💥🎉.

Right now I have applied the following optimization to my blog and I will write
about them soon.

* [gatsby-remark-images](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-remark-images/?=gatsby-remark-images): Optimizes all images in this blog, with lazy-loading and blurred preview.
* [gatsby-plugin-manifest](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-plugin-manifest/?=manife): Add nicely formatted `manifest.json` to this site.
* [gatsby-plugin-sitemap](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-plugin-sitemap/?=gatsby-plugin-sitemap): Automatically add sitemap and you can submit to google.
* [react-share](https://github.com/nygardk/react-share): For the share buttons you see below this article. Do share bdw ❤️.
* [disqus-react](https://github.com/disqus/disqus-react): For the commenting system.
* [gatsby-pagination](https://github.com/infinitedescent/gatsby-pagination): For creating paginated blog pages and linked articles.

plus more and I have just started. More tutorials will follow on how to implement them.

Stay tuned.
