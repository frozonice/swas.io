I am glad to announce [Beautiful UI](https://vscbui.rocks) 1.2 for [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

It has 5 new color themes. 4 of them are minimal color theme inspired by [Subliminal](https://github.com/gaearon/subliminal)
from [Dan Abramov](https://github.com/gaearon). See them below.

### Minimal Yellow VSCode Color Theme

Also I really liked the background and foreground color of the minimal themes.
So created a variation of Tomorrow Night theme. I call it **ðŸ’¥ Tomorrow Subliminal ðŸ’¥**.
