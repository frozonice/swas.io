> Full-stack web developer and WordPress geek.

Hey there, welcome to my blog. I like to consider myself a *Web Engineer*, focusing my mind on WordPress development. I have founded [WPQuark WebTech Private Limited](https://wpquark.com) and developed quite a few numbers of [WordPress plugins](#work).

WordPress Theme and Plugin development are two of my strongest skills. It needlessly explains my proficiency in PHP, MySQL, jQuery/JS, CSS and HTML.

Apart from WordPress, I also like to find my way around System Administration stuff, like installing and managing full LEMP stack. You can read more about it in my first blog [inTechGrity](https://intechgrity.com).

When I am not doing these things, I am usually playing with my buddy Scooby, or riding my Motor Cycle or just out having fun.

Below you will find some of my latest projects.
